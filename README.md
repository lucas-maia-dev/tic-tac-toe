## Tic Tac Toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game made with Next.js. In addition to creating a custom hook, I also used some React hooks such as:

- useEffect
- useSate
- useContext

In this first version it is possible to play a player vs player match and in the future I intend to implement the player vc computer mode.
